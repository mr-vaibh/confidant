    question: "How is my data secured with Confidant?",

  },
  {
    question: "What if I lose my private key?",
    answer:
      "Your private key is essential for decrypting your data. If itâ€™s lost, Confidant cannot recover your secrets. We strongly recommend backing it up securely.",

  },
  {
    question: "Do you store my private key on your servers?",
    answer:
      "No. Your private key never leaves your device. Confidant stores only your public key to encrypt secrets. This ensures maximum security and zero-trust architecture.",
